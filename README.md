# An introduction

So what is the Anti Hackintosh Buyers Guide and why should you care about this post? Well this is a guide of what not to buy whne building a hackintosh and will be kept up-to-date as new hardwrae comes out. While this guide won't give exact recommendations, it'll try and point you in the right direction.

# CPUs

**CPUs To Avoid:**

While AMD CPUs can work but we advise highly agaisnt them due to numerous issues still plaguing them as they're not natively supported. They require quite a bit more work to get setup but for those who like pain there is the [AMD Vanilla Guide](https://vanilla.amd-osx.com)

* AMD Ryzen 1000 Series
* AMD Ryzen 2000 Series
* AMD Ryzen 3000 Series
* AMD FX Series

With intel, the thanks to most of the CPUs being quite similar they have support when the CPU is spoofed to a supported model. The only downside is that the iGPU rarely work on these models meaning a cheap iGPU hackintosh is impossible with these CPUs. 

* Intel Atoms
* Intel Celerons
* Intel Pentiums
* Intel X99/LGA 2011

# GPUs

~~Get an RTX GPU, I want to see people suffer as they slowly realize that they don't even have suprt in HighSierra. Let the Nvidia fans die a slow and painful death, let this be a reminder to never cross our lord and savior Tim Apple~~
If you don't want a headache, stay away from all Nvidia GPU that aren't kepler based. Currently(and likely forever), Turing and Volta GPUs have no support whatsoever in any version of macOS while Pascal and Maxwell have their support stopping in High Sierra while also requiring WebDrivers so they're not native GPUs.

With AMD, Navi GPUs drivers are currently not included in either macOS Mojave 10.14.6 nor macOS Catalina 10.15 so please hold off until these GPUs have drivers included in macOS. And Lexa based AMD GPUs like the RX 550 have never had support

For GPUs we recommend, check out the [Mojave GPU Buyers Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/b91vf5/mojave_gpu_buyers_guide/) and the soon to come Catalina GPU Buyers Guide
