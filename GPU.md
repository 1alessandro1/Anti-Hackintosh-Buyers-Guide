~~Get an RTX GPU, I want to see people suffer as they slowly realize that they don't even have support in HighSierra. Let the Nvidia fans die a slow and painful death, let this be a reminder to never cross our lord and saviour Tim Apple~~
If you don't want a headache, stay away from all Nvidia GPUs that aren't Kepler based. Currently(and likely forever), Turing and Volta GPUs have no support whatsoever in any version of macOS while Pascal and Maxwell have their support stopping in High Sierra while also requiring WebDrivers so they're not native GPUs(this is important because that means another point of failure)

>  B-b-but are the drivers out yet?

For GPUs we recommend, check out the [GPU Buyers Guide](https://khronokernel-3.gitbook.io/catalina-gpu-buyers-guide/)
And for those who are running unsupported GPUs, there's still hope for you! With my patent pending [**How to disable your unsupported GPU for macOS Guide**](https://khronokernel-4.gitbook.io/disable-unsupported-gpus/), even a simpleton like you can experience the glories of Mojave and beyond!

> Are there any GPU board partners I should avoid when buying a GPU? 

Why I'm glad you asked, most manufactures actually have a pretty good track record with Hackintoshes but there's 2 specific brands to avoid. While it is possible to install with these GPUs, there still is a high possibility of issues arising like instability and black screens:
* XFX(may work with CSM/legacy mode turned off, make sure it's in UEFI mode)
* Powercolor

Note: AMD Navi support is still quite finiky, with WhateverGreen not being updated yet
