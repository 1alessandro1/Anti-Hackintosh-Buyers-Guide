Keep in mind that with an AIO and any cooler that relies on USB will generally have their fan curves, pump speed and RGB lighting reset when booting macOS. Some users in the community may have developed a driver/application for controlling your model of AIO but do your research to know if yours is affected/has a solution. Solution for this is to control the fans and pump speed with the motherboard instead

**Coolers to avoid**
* No specific models or manufactures but do your research
