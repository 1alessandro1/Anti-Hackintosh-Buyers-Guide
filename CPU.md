**CPUs to avoid:**

While AMD CPUs can work but we advise against them due to numerous issues still plaguing them as they're not natively supported. They require quite a bit more work to get setup but for those who like would prefer AMD there is the [AMD Vanilla Guide](https://vanilla.amd-osx.com). Do note that Adobe products and Virtual machines are 2 most common issues surrounding them.

* AMD Ryzen 1000 Series
* AMD Ryzen 2000 Series
* AMD Ryzen 3000 Series
* AMD Athlon
* AMD ThreadRipper
* AMD FX Series

With Intel, the thanks to most of the CPUs being quite similar they have support when the CPU is spoofed to a supported model. The only downside is that the iGPU rarely work on Atom/Pentium/Celeron these models meaning a cheap iGPU Hackintosh is impossible with these CPUs. Regarding X99/LGA 2011-V3 CPUs, there's the issue that these CPUs were never shipped in a real Mac so quite a few issues are present when running macOS on these systems. Avoid if possible

**Dual Socket User Note**: Do note that macOS Catalina no longer supports dual socket CPUs and that the macOS kernel only supports a maximum of 64 threads. So for baller setups please be aware.

* Intel Atoms
* Intel Celerons
* Intel Pentiums
* Intel X79/LGA 2011
* Intel X99/LGA 2011-V3
