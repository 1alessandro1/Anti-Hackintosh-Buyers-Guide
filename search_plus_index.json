Well, this is a guide of what not to buy when building a Hackintosh and will be kept up-to-date as new hardware comes out. While this guide won't give exact recommendations, it'll try and point you in the right direction.

They require quite a bit more work to get setup but for those who like would prefer AMD there is the AMD Vanilla Guide. Common issues with AMD: Adobe Products don't always work and there is no fix for lightroom at the moment some fixes can be found here: Adobe Fixes Do note these fixes just disable functionality, they're not real fixes Virtual Machine running off of AppleHV's framework will not work(ie: Parallels 15) VirtualBox works fine as it doesn't use AppleHV Docker broken Docker toolbox is based off of VirtualBox, many features are unavailable with this Xcode AppleWatch simulator is broken in Catalina Mojave works fine Microphone input is not available with AppleALC requiring VoodooHDA(quite a bit worse audio quality and overall instability) Audio Drift issues on Ryzen APUs(G series Chips) USB DAC is only fix besides new CPU Difficult to setup Sleep(or impossible on some systems) No CPU Power Management Not all USB ports work on some boards This is due to not being assigned in ACPI, you need to manually add them in your DSDT Delayed updates 3rd Gen Threadripper doesn't work at all AMD CPUs: AMD Ryzen 1000 Series AMD Ryzen 2000 Series AMD Ryzen 3000 Series AMD Athlon AMD ThreadRipper AMD FX Series With Intel, the thanks to most of the CPUs being quite similar they have support when the CPU is spoofed to a supported model. The only downside is that the iGPU rarely work on Atom/Pentium/Celeron these models meaning a cheap iGPU Hackintosh is impossible with these CPUs. Regarding X99/LGA 2011-V3 CPUs, there's the issue that these CPUs were never shipped in a real Mac so quite a few issues are present when running macOS on these systems. Avoid if possible Dual Socket User Note: Do note that the macOS kernel only supports a maximum of 64 threads. So for baller setups please be aware. And for dual socket users, you will need to use AppleMCEReporterDisabler in macOS Catalina Intel Atoms Intel Celerons Intel Pentiums Intel X79/LGA 2011 Intel X99/LGA 2011-V3 Intel X299/LGA-2066 Unsupported CPUs So with outright unsupported CPUs, you're split into 2 camps: Either too old to run or too new that patches aren't supported Too old to run: This mainly consists of CPUs that are missing the SSE4.2 instruction set required for Mojave and newer, you can get around this by replacing the telemetry plugin but not ideal. See trashOS repo for more info Wolfdale (Intel Core2 Duo series) E7xxx E8xxx Yorkfeild (Intel Core2 Quad series) E8xxx E9xxx Then there's the CPUs that are missing the SSE4.1 and older instruction sets, with these support is stuck an OS X 10.11 El Capitan Too new to run Well with this, the only current solution is to run it in a KVM, this is due to the current kernel patches not supporting 19h 3rd Gen Threadripper 3960X 3970X 3990X(the macOS kernel doesn't even support more than 64 threads) "},"GPU.html":{"url":"GPU.html","title":"GPU","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Sun Apr 26 2020 15:39:46 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) GPUs Get an RTX GPU, I want to see people suffer as they slowly realize that they don't even have support in HighSierra. Let the Nvidia fans die a slow and painful death, let this be a reminder to never cross our lord and saviour Tim Apple If you don't want a headache, stay away from all Nvidia GPUs that aren't Kepler based. Currently(and likely forever), Turing and Volta GPUs have no support whatsoever in any version of macOS while Pascal and Maxwell have their support stopping in High Sierra while also requiring WebDrivers so they're not native GPUs(this is important because that means another point of failure) B-b-but are the drivers out yet? For GPUs we recommend, check out the GPU Buyers Guide And for those who are running unsupported GPUs, there's still hope for you! With my patent pending How to disable your unsupported GPU for macOS Guide, even a simpleton like you can experience the glories of Mojave and beyond! Are there any GPU board partners I should avoid when buying a GPU? Why I'm glad you asked, most manufactures actually have a pretty good track record with Hackintoshes but there's 2 specific brands to avoid. While it is possible to install with these GPUs, there still is a high possibility of issues arising like instability and black screens: XFX(may work with CSM/legacy mode turned off, make sure it's in UEFI mode) Powercolor Note: AMD Navi support is still quite finicky, with WhateverGreen not being updated yet GPUs that aren't supported AT ALL Turing Titan RTX RTX 2080 Ti RTX 2080 Super RTX 2080 RTX 2070 Super RTX 2070 RTX 2060 Super RTX 2060 GTX 1660 Ti GTX 1660 GTX 1650 Quadro RTX 8000 Quadro RTX 6000 Quadro RTX 5000 Quadro RTX 4000 Volta Titan V Titan V CEO Edition Quadro GV100 Lexa RX 540/X RX 550/X GPUs to avoid Pascal GTX Titan X(GP 102-400 Pascal core) GTX Titan Xp(GP 102-450 Pascal core) GTX 1080/Ti GTX 1070/Ti GTX 1060 GTX 1050/Ti GT 1030 Quadro P400 Quadro P600 Quadro P620 Quadro P1000 Quadro P2000 Quadro P4000 Quadro P5000 Quadro P6000 Quadro GP100 Maxwell GTX Titan X(GM 200 Maxwell core) GTX 980/ti GTX 970 GTX 960 GTX 950 GTX 750/ti GTX 745 Quadro K620 Quadro K1200 Quadro K220 Quadro M2000 Quadro M4000 Quadro M5000 Quadro M6000 "},"Motherboard.html":{"url":"Motherboard.html","title":"Motherboard","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Sun Apr 26 2020 15:39:46 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) Motherboards So with motherboards, the main thing to keep in mind is what controllers your system is running, specifically: Audio Interface Controller Networking Interface Controller (Ethernet) USB Controllers NVRAM iGPU RTC vs AWAC Memory Maps and Protections The main brand to avoid are: MSI(Weird Memory Layout that requires KASLR fix and just really poor ACPI programming, many Z390 systems are unbootable on Clover) AsRock(non-native USB controller, Weird Memory Layout) Gigabyte(Weird Memory Layout, requires KASLR fix) And main platform to avoid: X79 X99 X299 C612 C621 C422 B360 B365 H310 H370 Z390 See below for more info Audio With audio, most boards are supported and you can find a more extensive list from AppleALC for audio.

For AsRock users with Intel CPUs, you'll need to use XHCI-unsupported.kext(which can be found within Rehabman's USBInjectAll's project. Many H370, B360, H310 and X79/X99/X299 users can also benefit from this Special AMD Note: Due to how macOS builds USBs, they must be defined somewhere in the ACPI tables. For some reason, many AMD boards just forget to do this and users end up with a lot of broken USB ports. There is a fix but it involves manually adding the ports to the DSDT or SSDT NVRAM With NVRAM, things have been mostly fixed for consumer platforms thanks to SSDT-PMC. Mainly relevant for the following: Z390 H370 B360 H310 There are however some boards without supported NVRAM, mainly HEDT and server boards: C612 C621 C422 X79 X99 X299(Asus has working NVRAM though) iGPU So fun part about Coffee Lake is that Intel changed a lot in how the iGPU display out work. Specifically that macOS has no clue how to properly address them. There is a fix but requires manual BusID patches through WhateverGreen. Main victims of this: Z390 H370 B360 H310 Note that Z370 is not on the list, this is because the board is basically a Z270 so Apple's video map works fine with it RTC vs AWAC With RTC vs AWAC, macOS outright won't boot with systems that have their clocks using AWAC and most BIOS GUIs don't even show the option to change it. This is mainly seen in the following: Z390 H370 B360 H310 Z370(mainly Gigabyte and AsRock, as they back-ported the clock. Other boards are fine) X299(mainly ones released with 10th gen CPUs, AsRock and Gigabyte are the 2 main offenders) So we need to either: force RTC with an SSDT, create a fake systems clock patch it out You can find more info here on how to fix it: Getting started with ACPI Memory Maps and Protections With this, main users affected: C612 (generally seen in server boards) C621 C422 X79 X99 X299 B360 B365 H310 H370 Z390 The issue these platforms face is that many rely on OsxAptioFix2Drv-free2000 which is now considered destructive to your system meaning build guides based of it are now invalid. More info can be found here. These issues can mostly be alleviated by calculating your slide value: Understanding and fixing \"Couldn't allocate runtime area\" errors Oh but to add to the fun, Intel introduced Memory protections which mean a lot of the firmware fixes provided by AptioMemoryFix/Opencore are completely broken. Specifically that any memory patches provided are overrided meaning they're never used. Luckily OpenCore introduced a new quirk called ProtectUefiServices which helps fix this by ensuring the patches are applied even after they're reset. "},"Storage.html":{"url":"Storage.html","title":"Storage","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Sun Apr 26 2020 15:39:46 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) Storage Storage is a section that can be quite confusing as there a lot of mixed reports regarding PCIe/NVMe based devices, many of these reports are based off old information from back when PCIe/NVMe drives were not natively supported like block size mattering or require kexts/.efi drivers. Well, High Sierra brought native support for these types of drives but certain ones still do not work and can cause instability if not removed/blocked out at an ACPI level. The other big issue surrounds all Samsung NVMe drives, specifically that they're known to slow down macOS, not play well with TRIM and even create instability at times. This is due to the Pheonix controller found on Samsung drives that macOS isn't too fond of, much preferring the Phison controller found in Sabrent Rocket drives and Western Digital's in-house controllers(WD SN750). The easiest way to see this is with boot up, most systems running Samsung drives will have extra long boot times and have their drives run hotter due to the software TRIM failing(hardware TRIM still should be enabled but no partiality). Also some older Intel drives and Kingston NVMe drives also experience these issues. And while not an issue anymore, do note that all of Apple's PCIe drives are 4k sector-based so for best support only choose drives with such sectors. Note for laptop users: Intel SSDs don't always play nicely with laptops and can cause issues, avoid when possible SSDs that aren't supported AT ALL Any eMMC based SSD(Commonly found in netbooks) Samsung PM981 (Commonly found in OEM systems like laptops) PM981 has been fixed with NVMeFix ver. 1.0.2 Micron 2200S Many users have report boot issues with this drive SSDs to avoid Samsung: Samsung 970 Evo Plus (While not natively supported out of the box, a firmware update from Samsung will allow these drives to operate in macOS) For all NVme SSDs, its recommended to use NVMeFix.kext to fix power and energy consumption on these drives "},"RAM.html":{"url":"RAM.html","title":"RAM","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Sun Apr 26 2020 15:39:46 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) RAM With RAM, it's generally the same logic for Windows: Make sure the CPU's memory controller can support the speeds you wish to run. macOS seems to be a bit more memory sensitive than Windows so you may get random lock-ups/kernel panics and the more memory you add, the more you need to lower the frequency to ease the memory controller. Generally, 32GB 3000Mhz will run just fine on an i7 8700k but an i7 6700k may have to drop to 2666Mhz for stability reasons "},"Cooler.html":{"url":"Cooler.html","title":"Cooler","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Sun Apr 26 2020 15:39:46 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) Coolers Keep in mind that with an AIO and any cooler that relies on USB will generally have their fan curves, pump speed and RGB lighting reset when booting macOS.
